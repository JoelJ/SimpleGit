	<p>RefSpecs to be fetched. Blank for the default refSpec to be used. Each refSpec should be on its own line.</p>
	<p>For example, if you want to checkout a GitHub pull request branch, you would use:<br/><br/><code>+refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*</code></p>
	<p>However, if you want to fetch pull request branch and compare it to a non- pull request branch, you would use:<br/><br/>
		<code>
			+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*<br/>
			+refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
		</code>
	</p>
